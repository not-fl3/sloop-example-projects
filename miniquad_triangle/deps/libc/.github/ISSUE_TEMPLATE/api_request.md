Please provide the below information:

* the target triple
* link to the documentation of the API showing the type signatures, how to use
  it, etc.

In general, just please consider that the people who can help you are all very
busy, they will be helping you in their free time, there are a lot of people in
need of help so they need to prioritize to which issues they devote their free
time, etc. So try to give most of the information upfront, be concise, show
small self-contained examples (nobody has time to create a new cargo project,
set up dependencies,...), etc. Help us help you.
